Simple Tech Product Pages
This repository contains two basic HTML pages designed to showcase tech products and provide a thank you message after a simulated purchase.

Files
index.html (or your landing page name):

This is the main landing page.

It displays two placeholder tech products with descriptions, features, prices, and "Buy Now" buttons.

The "Buy Now" buttons are linked to product1-details.html and product2-details.html (which are placeholders for your actual product detail pages).

thank-you.html (or your thank you page name):

This page serves as a confirmation page after a successful purchase.

It displays a thank you message and a button to "Continue Shopping" (which links back to index.html).

How to Use
To view these pages:

Save the content of the "Tech Products Landing Page" immersive as index.html (or landing-page.html).

Save the content of the "Thank You Page" immersive as thank-you.html.

Ensure both files are in the same folder.

Open index.html in your web browser.

You can then click the "Buy Now" button on the landing page to simulate a purchase flow, which would ideally redirect to the thank-you.html page.

Customization
Content: Easily update product names, descriptions, features, and prices directly in the index.html file.

Images: Replace the placehold.co image URLs with your actual product images.

Links: Update the href attributes for the "Buy Now" buttons to link to your real product detail pages.

Styling: Both pages use Tailwind CSS. You can modify the Tailwind classes or add custom CSS within the <style> tags to change the appearance.
